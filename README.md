# Transport Data EDA: Fuel Efficiency and EV Growth Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a transportation dataset to gain insights into vehicle registrations, fuel consumption patterns, and the growth of electric vehicles (EVs).

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the `fact_transport.csv` dataset, which contains information related to vehicle registrations, fuel types (petrol, diesel, electric), vehicle classes (motorcycle, motor car, auto rickshaw, agriculture, others), and seating capacities.

## Key Insights and Visualizations
The EDA process covered several aspects, visualized through various plots:

### 1. Fuel Efficiency Insights
* **Vehicle Class Distribution:** A bar plot shows the total vehicle registrations across different vehicle classes.
* **Fuel Consumption by Type:** A bar plot illustrates the total vehicle registrations by fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric).

### 2. Fuel Consumption Trends Over Time
* A line plot visualizes the trends of petrol, diesel, and electric vehicle registrations over time, highlighting shifts in fuel preferences.

### 3. Electric Vehicle (EV) Growth Projection
* A dedicated line plot specifically tracks the growth of electric vehicle registrations month-over-month, indicating the increasing adoption of EVs.

### 4. Fuel vs. Seating Capacity
* **Seating Capacity Distribution:** A bar plot displays the total vehicles registered across different seating capacity categories (1-3, 4-6, above 6).
* **Fuel Type Distribution within Seating Capacity:** Another bar plot provides insights into which fuel types are prevalent within different seating capacity ranges.

### 5. Correlation Analysis
* A heatmap shows the correlation matrix between different fuel types and seating capacity categories, helping to identify relationships between these variables.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* Matplotlib (for plotting)
* Seaborn (for enhanced visualizations)
